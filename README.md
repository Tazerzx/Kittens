A rewrite of the amazing [Kitten Game](http://bloodrizer.ru/games/kittens/) in ES6 & React.

[Original Repo](https://bitbucket.org/bloodrizer/kitten-game)

I claim no copyright, patent, intillectual property, or ownership over the name, concept, or initial creation of "Kitten Game." I just really love the game and figured it was as good a reason as any to try out ES6 and React.

`You are a kitten in a catnip forest.`

### General Information ###

* https://www.reddit.com/r/kittensgame
* https://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/1.7/dojo/index.html#dojo-index (I'm using mostly pre-1.7 dojo functionality)

### Roadmap ###

* UI
    * Resources
        * Edit icon for craft table to show/hide individual craft recipes

* QOL/Other
    * ~~Ziggurat upgrades should be hidden by default and unlocked one by one~~

* Features
    * Leaders should give a special minor bonus based on trait (and rank)
    * Planetary cycles should give cosmetic gameplay bonuses/penalties

* Portability
    * ~~Render/Update loops should be decoupled from the Game class.~~
        *  ~~Game should be probably splitted into GameCore and GameClient with the option to provide arbitrary implementation of the GameClient~~
    * Most of the logic in the button handlers should be moved to the corresponding manager methods

Please feel free to add other suggestions.

### Contribution guidelines ###

TBD
